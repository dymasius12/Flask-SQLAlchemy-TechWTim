Hi this is a working code for the Video RESTFUL API from the Youtube video by Tech With Team https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk 

Some Important notes:

1. Please know that I use conda venv while doing this. There might be differences between pip and conda. 
2. This is my own requirements.txt: my-requirements.txt
